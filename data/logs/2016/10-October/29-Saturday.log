[10:39:40]ADMIN: ThingPony/(Erica Stamos) has created a command report: A marine biologist developed a race of genetically engineered dolphins that could live forever if they were fed a steady diet of seagulls. One day, his supply of the birds ran out so he had to go out and trap some more. On the way back, he spied two lions asleep on the road. Afraid to wake them, he gingerly stepped over them. Immediately, he was arrested and charged with -- transporting gulls across sedate lions for immortal porpoises.

Zander looked back at the other, seeing him slowly start to undress, his own face getting red in the process. He stayed silent as he watched, aside from taking amoment to respond on the headset. Licking his lips, slightly, he stared down at Gunner&#39;s cock. &#34;I-I...Mm...I...&#34; Zander studders over himself for a moment, before slowly walking forward and dropping to his knees, opening his mouth in front of the other&#39;s cock and giving it a lick.

[12:30:06]EMOTE: Gunner Smirnov/KriegsmarineOffizier : <B>Gunner Smirnov</B> chuckles lightly, watching the other male the entire time, eyes following him even as he got closer. He didn&#39;t seem to mind in even the slightest. He&#39;d slide his paws down his head, through as hair, moaning ever so gently at the lick upon his shaft, ushering out a dot of precum right from his tip. &#34;Mrr- I-I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d be t-that quick to hop directly for it, handsome~ I normally prefer many more ... romantic sublties~&#34; He&#39;d say, chuckling as he watched.

[12:33:35]EMOTE: Zander Sylphaen/Twilightic : <B>Zander Sylphaen</B> would begin to softly emit a low purr as Gunner lightly rubbed his hand against his head and hair, nuzzling against it lightly.  Zander would wrap his lips around the head, licking the tip free of pre, letting its sweet taste stay on his tongue for a moment as he began to lick arlong it further. Upon hearing his words, he quickly pulled back away, his face a darker shade of red. &#34;O-OH MY GOD! I&#39;m so sorry!&#34;
