And tried to pull a deployable barrier to departures to stop people from going into a breached hallway.  Of course, it couldn\'t USE the barrier.  But still.  So, he got it locked down deconstructed it completely, and when I possessed the brain to let it get to him and talk to him, he tossed it in the recycler.  Literally removing a player (not for long, as he\'s a posibrain again) from the round for no other reason than he found them \'obnoxious\'     - Doesn\'t seem to understand new concept of Ai laws
