[05:32:46]ADMIN: PM: KriegsmarineOffizier/(Gunner Smirnov)->ThingPony/(Erica Stamos): Actually, no. I gave them that before I even really had plans flow out to RP. I always deign the spare to someone close in my departments, if there is no head available, usually security if I trust them. I never once asked her to do anything for me. She volunteered for every bit of it, and if she hadn;t, I would have done it.

He gave the bridge officer the spare, pretty much round start, and let them take over for acting captain while he went into the captains office and ERPed. Granted, he did keep his headset on and his PDA close by, but he should still be handed those issues. Not letting a  non-head do his job for him.

You may ask Areli, that I would have, at any time, left that RP, and dealt with it.  I&#39;ve done it before, can and WILL do it again.
