I mean, sure, I&#39;ve been married for...four years or so now? Er, human years - time makes less sense the more places you spend time at, because good luck having a consistant time cycle. It&#39;s an open relationship, and sometimes I do question whether he actually loves me, but...I know he does. Just as he knows I love him, in my weird sort of way.&#34;

[11:43:50]SAY: Ghost/kriegsmarineoffizier : I&#39;m wondering what&#39;s the point of this though.
[11:44:02]SAY: Ghost/rubyflamewing : I did, because half the time, I presume I should be aware. Working as MD or even Security in general kind of got me to keep an eye out for new arrivals.
[11:44:09]ADMIN: DSAY: Gozulio/(Mackenzie Hice) : RNGsus nukie
[11:44:22]ADMIN: DSAY: Gozulio/(Mackenzie Hice) : bet you where wishing the ninja was back?

[11:45:54]SAY: Ghost/rubyflamewing : Anyways, I do have a question.
[11:45:59]SAY: Ghost/kriegsmarineoffizier : Hmmmm?
[11:46:19]SAY: Ghost/rubyflamewing : I saw someone hulk out after getting the championship belt from the safe on Citadel. Is that in here, Eira?

[11:46:30]SAY: Ghost/rubyflamewing : And does it have something to it that makes you become a hulk?
[11:46:43]SAY: Ghost/kriegsmarineoffizier : That was likely an admin thing on citadel.
[11:46:46]SAY: Poly/ : OH GOD ITS FREE CALL THE SHUTTLE

[11:47:13]SAY: Ghost/kriegsmarineoffizier : But, it is possible to get a HULK serum, from the cargo shuttle.
[11:47:33]SAY: Ghost/rubyflamewing : Well, the belt itself didn&#39;t do it - something called &#34;Hulk Hogan&#39;s Private Steroid Stash&#34; did, and it was a syringe.
[11:47:44]SAY: Ghost/kriegsmarineoffizier : Yeah. It came from the shuttle then.
[11:47:47]SAY: Ghost/rubyflamewing : I figured it was hidden in the belt.
[11:47:59]EMOTE: monkey (927)/ : <B>The monkey (927)</B> jumps!
[11:47:59]SAY: Ghost/kriegsmarineoffizier : Someone emagged the cargo shuttle, bought syndie crates, and that&#39;s what they got.

And I&#39;m not reprimanding you, just asking in the future you let staff take care of it, as people who play heads of staff should already know how to play heads of staff.

While we applaud your attempt to rid the ship of the vine menace.

It would appear that in the time it has taken for one person to get back, all the vines he got regrew!  

Who knew these dastardly plants could grow so well in a vacuum.  Maybe we should make ships out of them. 

Would you folks like to just have them scraped off the side of the vessel?  Or would you want to just dock and have us burn them off with lasers.  The second choice involves sending you home early, though.
